Getting Started
===============

If you wish to run the fh-immuta-utils CLI locally, you'll first need to set up a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment.

``` bash
fh-immuta-utils/ $ conda-env create
```

The above command will create a conda environment called `fh-immuta-utils` with all the requirements needed to develop on or utilize fh-immuta-utils.

For more info, see the documentation in the repo.
